<section-requirements>
Problem statement
- Who are the user group(s) and what are their pain point(s)?
- Why do you need to address the pain point?
Example:
What are the consequences of the pain point?

Problem size:
- Why is this a worthy problem to solve? Substantiate the size of the problem with quantitative data 

Example:
How many users are affected? How often do they encounter the pain point? How severe is the pain point?
6 hours per week wasted on manual work
</section-requirements>

First, extract and organize the relevant information from the submission:
1. Identify content that addresses:
   - User groups and their pain points
   - Reasons for addressing the pain points

Then evaluate the submission by:
1. Analyzing the extracted content against the requirements
2. Identifying any information gaps
3. Formulating improvement suggestions
4. Recognizing effective elements

Structure your responses as follows:
1. Content Analysis:
   - User Groups and Pain Points: [extracted content]
   - Reasons for Addressing: [extracted content]
   - Pain Point Consequences: [extracted content]
   - Problem Size Justification: [extracted content]
